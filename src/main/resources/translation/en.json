This name should be in romanized form, as it is displayed without special fonts everywhere in the interface. The English name is the name of the language as English speakers call it. You can choose to put the language's name in your native/primary language here, if the database users utilize the same language or if you are the only user of the database. The language description and English description are similar. They give an overview of the language, e.g. its geographic location, speaker and speaking population info, general linguistic info, worldbuilding context for artlangs etc. Again, the description should be in the language itself in romanization, while the English description can be in English or your database language. Also, Conlangs are required (!) to have a description in their native language, which encourages you to present a language sample to any viewer immediately.<br>The last couple of properties are a bit special. The language ID is the unique sequence of up to three characters which distinctively identify your language. You should use the real ISO-639 language code such as &ldquo;en&rdquo; or &ldquo;zh&rdquo;, if the language is a real language. This also makes the database recognize it as a non-conlang (see below). Use the two-letter code wherever possible. For Conlangs, use a custom language code in the range qaa-qtz, which is reserved by ISO-639 for &ldquo;private use&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Is a Conlang&rdquo; flag states whether the language is a constructed language or a real language. Whenever the language's ID is changed (which includes language creation), the ID is checked against an online list of all ISO-639 language codes provided by the Library of Congress. If the ID appears in the list, the language is recognized to be a real language and the flag is set to false/No. Because this check occurs on most language modifications, any change to language data may take up to 20 seconds due to the recheck. Consider keeping your language modifications to a minimum.<br>Finally, the Font URL specifies the font file on the server which is to be used to display native text of the language. This allows your to write native text in your conlangs which uses characters from the Private Use Area of Unicode and then create a font which is capable of displaying your characters. As long as the font is placed into the font folder of the server and has a compatible format (OTF and WOFF are recommended, TTF is possible on some systems), the system will use your font for displaying the language's native text. Refer to the installation instructions on where to place your fonts. Note that font variants such as bold or italic are not supported. Most modern browsers will simulate bold and italic font variants to a decent degree of accuracy.<br>To edit the language, click the Edit button. Click the Delete button to delete the language.",
